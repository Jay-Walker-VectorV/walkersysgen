Walker Solar System Generator: a planetary system generator that actually gets it right


I have found a lot of different solar system generators over time, and all of them have had some kind of issue, so I decided to make one that doesn't. 
Use this for your RPG settings, please!


"Generate system" generates one star system.


"Generate sector" generates 125 star systems, the approximate amount located in a 34x34x34 ly sector of space.


"Generate 500 systems" does exactly what you'd expect.
